# 📅 Dot Journal

**A minimalist space to visualize time and memory.**

Dot Journal reimagines the standard calendar as an interactive canvas. Instead of boxes and lists, your year is mapped as a living grid of dots, giving you a unique perspective on the passage of time and the shape of your life.

## ✨ The Experience

- **Your Year at a Glance**
  Every day of the year is represented by a single dot.
  - **The Past:** Solid and permanent.
  - **The Present:** Glowing and active.
  - **The Future:** Faded and waiting.

- **Interactive & Tactile**
  The grid feels alive. Move your mouse across the days, and the dots gently scatter and ripple around your cursor, adding a moment of playfulness to your daily reflection.

- **Visual Progress**
  A sleek circular gauge in the header shows you exactly where you stand in the current year, grounding you in the present moment.

- **Private by Design**
  Your thoughts are yours alone. Currently, all entries are saved directly to your device's local memory. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.

- **Distraction-Free Writing**
  Click any active dot to open a clean, focused writing space. Capture a thought, a memory, or a feeling, and watch that day's dot glow to mark it as "kept."
